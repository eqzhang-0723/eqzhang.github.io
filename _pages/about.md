I am a third-year master’s student at Nanjing University, School of Geography and Ocean Science. Since April 2025, I have been a Fellow at UNICEF Zimbabwe Country Office, working on child nutrition and early childhood development. My research interests include food markets, food security, energy economics, and inequality, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa.

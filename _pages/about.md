I am a third year master student from Nanjing University, School of Geography and Ocean Science. I have been working at UNICEF Zimbabwe Country Office with fellowship in Child Nutrition and Early Childhood Development since April 2025. My research interest includes food market, food security, energy economics and inequality, focusing on sub-Saharan Africa.
